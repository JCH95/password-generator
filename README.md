# Random Password Generator
This project is a random password generator. The user is met with a page with a section where the password will be displayed, and button that will generate a random password. Once the button is clicked, the user is met with a prompt to input the desired length of the password, and then is asked whether they want to include lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters to be added to the password. Then based on the desired length, the user will be given a random password created from the prompts they chose.
